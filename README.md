# Operating System Scheduler

This repository contains a project developed for the **Operating Systems** course, designed to showcase various CPU scheduling algorithms. The project implements and compares the following scheduling strategies:

- **FIFO (First In, First Out)**
- **HRRN (Highest Response Ratio Next)**
- **Multilevel Feedback Queue**
- **RR (Round Robin)**
- **SJF (Shortest Job First)**
- **SRT (Shortest Remaining Time)**
